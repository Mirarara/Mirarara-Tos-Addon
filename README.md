# Mirarara-Tos-Addon
Addon for Tree of Savior. 

## Instruction:  
**DOWNLOAD THE ADDON FROM [RELEASE](https://github.com/Mirarara/Mirarara-Tos-Addon/releases) PAGE**  
1. Copy Data and Addons folder into your Tree of ERP's folder.  
2. If you don't have Excrulon's addon manager installed, copy the release folder inside 'Do not Copy' folder into your Tree of ERP's folder.  

I will try to compile some of the addons to put on the addon manager. For addons that I think it's not good enough for addon manager yet, you have to get it from the release page.
